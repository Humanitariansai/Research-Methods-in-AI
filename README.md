# **Course Overview**

**Humanitarians AI — Research Methods in AI** is a community-driven, open-access educational project where volunteers—often recent graduates, students, and early-career technologists—**learn by teaching**.

This course is a **work in progress**, evolving through:

* Iterative outlines
* Community-generated lecture content
* GitHub-hosted hands-on labs
* Real-time expansion through **Humanitarians Courses GPT**
  [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6920a81baeb8819185cc8100ce963e95-humanitarians-courses](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6920a81baeb8819185cc8100ce963e95-humanitarians-courses)

The goal is to make AI research **accessible, ethical, inclusive, and socially beneficial**, supporting Humanitarians AI’s mission to empower underserved communities through responsible AI knowledge and tools.

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

The course follows the standard Humanitarians AI **“Learn → Build → Teach”** cycle:

1. **Start With an Outline**
   Contributors refine this outline collaboratively across the term.

2. **Hands-On Labs First**
   Before any lectures are recorded, volunteers produce:

   * Jupyter notebooks
   * Data analysis walkthroughs
   * Mini research studies
   * Critical reading exercises
   * Reproducible pipelines

3. **Use the Humanitarians Courses GPT for Content Creation**
   Volunteers generate:

   * Lecture scripts
   * Slides
   * Research templates
   * Dataset guides
   * Coding examples
   * Visual layouts

4. **YouTube Video Lectures**
   After labs are stable:

   * Core concept videos
   * Methods deep dives
   * AI ethics discussions
   * Research walkthroughs
   * Fellow-led tutorials

5. **Continuous Updating**
   New volunteers extend:

   * Open datasets
   * Tutorial notebooks
   * Recorded mini-lectures
   * Example research projects
